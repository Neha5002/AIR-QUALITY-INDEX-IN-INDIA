# Air Quality Prediction

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **air quality data** to understand pollution levels, trends, and patterns over time. The dataset includes key air pollutants and environmental indicators that help assess air quality and its potential impact on health and the environment.

The goal of this project is to perform **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization** to extract meaningful insights from air quality measurements.
##  Dataset Description
The dataset contains air quality readings collected over different locations and time periods. It includes pollutant concentrations and environmental variables commonly used in air quality monitoring.

###  Key Features
- **Date / Time** – Timestamp of observation  
- **PM2.5** – Fine particulate matter concentration  
- **PM10** – Coarse particulate matter concentration  
- **NO₂ (Nitrogen Dioxide)**  
- **SO₂ (Sulfur Dioxide)**  
- **CO (Carbon Monoxide)**  
- **O₃ (Ozone)**  
- **AQI (Air Quality Index)**  
- **Location / City** (if applicable)

## Objectives
- Analyze air pollution levels over time  
- Identify trends and seasonal patterns  
- Compare pollutant concentrations  
- Detect high-pollution periods  
- Understand relationships between pollutants and AQI

##  Sample Visualizations
- Line charts for pollutant trends  
- Bar charts for AQI comparison  
- Heatmaps for correlation analysis  
- Distribution plots for pollutant levels  

---

##  Key Insights
- Pollution levels vary significantly across time periods  
- Certain pollutants strongly influence AQI  
- Seasonal variations impact air quality  
- Peak pollution occurs during specific months

## Future Improvements

Add machine learning models for AQI prediction

Integrate real-time air quality APIs

Create interactive dashboards (Power BI / Tableau)

##  Conclusion
This project demonstrates how air quality data can be effectively analyzed to uncover meaningful insights about pollution levels and environmental conditions. Through data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization, key patterns and trends in air pollutant concentrations were identified.

The analysis highlights the significant impact of pollutants such as **PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, and O₃** on overall air quality and AQI levels. Seasonal variations and time-based trends indicate that air pollution is not constant and is influenced by environmental and human factors.

Overall, this project showcases practical skills in **data analysis, visualization, and environmental data interpretation**, making it a valuable addition to a data analytics portfolio. The insights derived can support better decision-making, awareness, and future predictive modeling related to air quality monitoring and public health.
